        URL: <A href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/">http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/</A></H4><P>Begun in 1995, this admirable hypermedia archive electronically
        records, page by page (with numbers included), different versions of
        the illuminated books of the much beloved and researched English poet,
        printmaker, and painter. The overwhelming success of the Blake Archive
        is due to the cooperation of its sponsors, the U.S. Library of Congress
        and several supporting institutions and corporations, among them The
        Getty Grant Program and the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
        Humanities at the University of Virginia, where the site is located.
        Editors holding the copyright--who are responsible for the superb
        quality of its images, commentary, and general scope--are Morris Eaves
        (Univ. of Rochester), Robert Essick (Univ. of California, Riverside)
        and Joseph Viscomi (Univ. of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The
        archive currently contains electronic editions of ten books, including
        Visions of the Daughters of Albion; America, a Prophecy; Songs of
        Innocence and of Experience; Europe, a Prophecy; and two versions of
        The Song of Los. The home page lists nine large sections; the most
        useful are Search the Blake Archive, Works in the Archive, and Selected
        Bibliography and Reference Works. The most important contribution of
        this truly awe-inspiring effort is the wonderful quality and fidelity
        of the images. Displayed under ideal conditions--highest color
        settings, full 64 megabytes of memory, using Explorer rather than
        Netscape--these remarkable computer images are a must-see for anyone
        concerned with electronic imaging of art works. The William Blake
        Archive goes further toward successful technological stimulation than
        of the aesthetic experience than any Web site thus far. This
        accomplishment seems due to the relatively small scale of the
        illuminated books; highly successful scanning of recent, accurate
        transparencies; and careful color checking. This site has just one
        minor drawback: complex state-of-the-art multilayered windows are
        daunting, and patient searching is demanded to learn the latest
        functions of the browser. Highest recommendation for all academic
        collections.</P><P class="c2">--M. Hamel-Schwulst, Towson University</P></TD></TR></TABLE><P class="c3">Reprinted with permission from <A href="http://www.ala.org/acrl/choice/">CHOICE</A>, copyright by the American
