Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem first published in 1743. Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. Blake etched one image, "Deaths Door," in white-line, but Cromek rejected it. The dark power of the white-line print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808. Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to <i>The Grave</i> became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century.
            </p><p>Blake’s first drafts of illustrations for <i>The Grave</i> include a number of pencil sketches.  Most are rough first thoughts on paper; some were developed into finished water colors and engraved by Schiavonetti, but other designs were not further developed.  We present here a selection of these pencil sketches.  Selections of Blake’s monochrome wash drawings and preliminary water colors for <i>The Grave</i> are also available in the Archive under their respective genre headings.
