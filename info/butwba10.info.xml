         In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to 
         prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>, a popular "Graveyard" school poem 
         first published in 1743.  Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition 
         of the poem.  In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer 
         and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, "Deaths Door," in white-line, but Cromek 
         rejected it.  The dark power of the white-line print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from 
         fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek 
         announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had 
         lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with 
         Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a 
         portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book 
         aggressively and the illustrations to <i>The Grave</i> became Blake's best known work through much of the 
         nineteenth century.
      </p><p>
         We present here the twenty water-color illustrations originally selected by Cromek for 
         publication.  These were sold at an auction in Edinburgh in 1836, but were unknown until the 
         dramatic rediscovery of nineteen of the water colors in 2001.  These were sold individually 
         at auction in May 2006 and are now widely dispersed; most are now in private collections.  
         For details about provenance and current ownership, see the Work Information page.
      </p><p>
         One design originally part of the group, as indicated by the size and style of its backing 
         mat, became detached from its companions, probably in the mid-nineteenth century.  This work, 
         <i>The Widow Embracing her Husband's Grave</i> (Yale Center for British Art, Butlin 633), has been 
         included here.  The designs are arranged according to the sequence of passages illustrated, 
         with those designs not based on any specific passage in Blair's poem grouped at the end.
